# React Container Graph

This is a [React]() component that consumes a [cccf]() configuration and outputs a graph of those containers.

It is also possible to overwrite the container component being used to decorate with container impl. spesific metadata and functionality. The prime example would be to pass a DockerGraphNode component instead of the basic GraphNode.
